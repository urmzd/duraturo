// Package queue defines the flow-and-clock interface: delivery of run IDs to
// workers under time-bounded, fenced claims. The queue carries only IDs —
// data lives in the ledger — and every queue backend is disposable: its
// entire content is derivable from the ledger, so wiping it loses no runs.
//
// Lifecycle per claim: claim → heartbeat* → exactly one of settle, release,
// expire. Delivery is at-least-once; exactly-once observation is
// manufactured above by the ledger's first-write-wins records and
// first-terminal-wins Complete.

// Item is a claimed run. The (RunID, Attempt) pair is the fencing token for
// every subsequent operation on the claim; Failures is the run's retry
// budget consumption. The two are deliberately separate counters: Attempt
// increments on every claim (fencing must be monotonic across the run's
// whole lineage, including park/resume cycles), while Failures counts only
// executions that actually failed — a voluntary Release back onto the queue
// or a lease that expired under its worker. Settling and re-enqueueing (how
// parked runs wait) never touches Failures, so waiting is free.

	// Claim blocks until a run is claimable or ctx is done, then hands it
	// to exactly one caller with a lease of ttl. The returned Item carries
	// the incremented attempt and the run's accumulated failure count; the

	// makes the run claimable again, and reclaiming it increments both the
	// attempt and — because the previous execution died — Failures.

	// Release gives the run back voluntarily, claimable again after delay.
	// Fenced by it.Attempt. failed says whether this execution consumed
	// retry budget: true after a retryable error (Failures increments),
	// false when the worker is merely interrupted (graceful shutdown) —
	// interruption is not a failure of the code, and deploys must not burn
	// the budget of long-running work.

	// Settle removes the run from the queue entirely: after a terminal
	// Complete, or when a run parks. Fenced by it.Attempt.
