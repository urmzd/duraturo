// Package run defines duraturo's leaf types: runs, records, deltas, and the
// sentinel errors every layer speaks. It is stdlib-only, imported by every
// other package, and imports none of them.
//
// A run is one durable invocation of a wrapped workflow function. A record is
// one memoized result inside a run — an activity checkpoint, a captured step
// of non-determinism, or an event. Record identity is (RunID, Key) where Key
// follows the activity, not its position in the code: the Kth call to
// "charge-payment" in program order is "charge-payment#2" (zero-indexed
// occurrences), an explicit user key is "k:<key>", and an event is
// "event:<name>#<k>". Identity-by-name is what lets code evolve freely against
// records that never change.
